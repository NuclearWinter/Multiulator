/* @name Program Usage
 * @brief How to use this program
 * @details The following details usage for various parts of this program.
 *
 * Within the main function there is handling for input. The input is stored within a vector that rotates every other
 *
 * For chemistry:
 *  temps are in celcius
 *  density at stp in g/L
 *  most common configuration first
 *  for the number of configurations just get the size of the array
